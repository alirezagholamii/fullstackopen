# Full Stack open 2021

The Full Stack Open course is an open and free online course provided by the University of Helsinki and its partners.

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data. This yearâ€™s edition of the course contains a new part on TypeScript.
